This is supposedly to be my github website!

Portfolio and Petty Practice Projects which promote my learning are to be hosted here.
The showcase part of the website is portfolio, though if you are curious to follow my learning journey 
you might be glad to know that after the hello_world(ie introductory lessons) the logical step up is 
this open repo and then the private personal projects.
