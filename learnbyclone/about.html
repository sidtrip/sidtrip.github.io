            <h3>I am teaching myself to code by <br>
            self learning and practicing.</h3>
            
            <p>I learnt about the power of growth mindset and doing things to perfection,
                rather than waiting for perfection to do things. One 
                <a href = "http://coth.ink/is-perfect-the-enemy-of-good"> such thought</a>
                 is captured in my blog which I started with a similar mind set. Various
                 folks in this journey together with the cohort of developers who believe in
                  paying forward made this journey just a little better hell(I won't promote
                  the mentality that coding is easy, and you could learn it in a week).
            
            </p>
            <p>Particularly here, I'll try and make a transition towards a comfortable 
                html/css writer and initialize myself to js slowly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know this is not necessarily a very healthy/well balanced approach to learning
                so I'll try and compliment it with books and towards bigger projects towards the end.
