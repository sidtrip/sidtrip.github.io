        <h1>Grey Matter, White Matter and Myelin Seath</h1>
        <p>Grey matter (or gray matter) is a major component of the central nervous
            system, consisting of neuronal cell bodies, neuropil (dendrites and
            unmyelinated axons), glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes),
            synapses, and capillaries.</p>

        <p> Such approach to sensitive and life altering topics is not a good
            idea. What they <em>actually</em> want to know is,

                What actually are grey matter? How do they get affected with aging,
                what benifit can I derive if I understand these scientific lingua of
                Grey Matter, White Matter, or Myelin Seath?
                Does it even matter to a non PhD. student to go into such convoluted
                spaces of Bilogical Study?
            </p>

        <p>Grey matter is distinguished from white matter in that it contains
            numerous cell bodies and relatively few myelinated axons,
            while white matter contains relatively few cell bodies and is composed
            chiefly of long-range myelinated axons.</p>

        <p>The colour difference arises mainly from the whiteness of myelin.
            In living tissue, grey matter actually has a very light grey colour
            with yellowish or pinkish hues, which come from capillary blood vessels
            and neuronal cell bodies.</p>

        <p>What they actually feel at this point is..</p>

                I had just a curiosity of it's practicality but now I am bombarded with
                even more irrelavant wornds that I dont understand and those term's are
                not even hyper linked!

            ..which is just lazy. If you're not willing to do the work to solve your
            problem, why should we?
        </p>
        <p>
            The solution is not to ask to ask, but just to ask. Someone who is idling
            on the channel and only every now and then glances what's going on is
            unlikely to answer to your "asking to ask" question, but your actual
            problem description may pique their interest and get them to answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, to summarize, don't ask
            <em>Vague Questions</em>,
            but rather ask
            <em>"What are the information that this person can facilitate me to understand?
                Since he is a scientist I should google the basic stuff, read up wikipedia,
                fill up the basic gaps in my understanding so that I can ask more advanced
                stuff that might be hard to grasp to this person!"</em>
